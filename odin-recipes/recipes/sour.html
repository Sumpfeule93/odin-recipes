				<h2>How To Make a Whiskey Sour</h2>
				<br>
				<p>If you've made other cocktails at home before, you won't have any trouble with a whiskey sour.</p>
				<br>
				<p>It's super straightforward: shake, strain, garnish, and serve.</p>
				<br>
				<p>If you're using the egg white, the one small difference from most shaken cocktails is that you'll actually shake it WITHOUT ice first. This is called a “dry shake,” and it helps incorporate the egg white into the whiskey, lemon juice, and simple syrup, giving the drink a thick texture and foamy top. Then, add the ice and shake until chilled.</p>
				<br>
				<p>A note on ratios: The classic ratio for a sour cocktail is 2 parts spirit to 1 part acid to 1 part sweetener. However, just like in my gimlet recipe, I like to use a higher ratio of spirit to allow the bourbon flavor to come through. Of course, feel free to adjust the ratios in this recipe to find a balance of flavors you love. Add more simple syrup for a sweeter drink, or use a little extra lemon for a brighter pop. Enjoy!</p>
